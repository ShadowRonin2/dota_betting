elo:
E_A + E_B = 1
    E_A = {Q_A}/{Q_A + Q_B}
and
    E_B = {Q_B}/{Q_A + Q_B}, 
where Q_A = 10^{R_A/400} and Q_B = 10^{R_B/400}
supposing Player A was expected to score E_A points but actually scored S_A points. The formula for updating his rating is
    R_A^\prime = R_A + K(S_A - E_A). 
K = 10

my MMR(for now):
as above except: R_A^\prime = R_A + K(wins - losses)
